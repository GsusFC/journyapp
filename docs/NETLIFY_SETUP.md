# 🚀 Netlify Setup Guide for Journy

To ensure the Journy application runs correctly in production, you must configure the following Environment Variables in the Netlify Dashboard.

## 📍 Where to add them?

1. Go to your Netlify Site Dashboard.
2. Navigate to **Site configuration** > **Environment variables**.
3. Click **Add a variable** > **Add a single variable** (or Import from .env).

## 🔑 Required Variables

| Variable Key | Description | Example Value |
|--------------|-------------|---------------|
| `VITE_WALLET_PROJECT_ID` | **CRITICAL**. The Project ID from Reown Cloud (formerly WalletConnect). | `349ee7a88d119a669be53f17c9449b78` |
| `VITE_PINATA_JWT` | **CRITICAL**. Your Pinata JWT Token for IPFS uploads. | `PASTE_YOUR_LONG_PINATA_JWT_HERE` |
| `VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` | The address of the deployed JournyLog contract on Base Sepolia. | `0xf5FeFabd1B0Ad49a0DE92B7c04FBa3518083Dc64` |
| `VITE_IPFS_GATEWAY` | The IPFS Gateway URL (Optional, defaults to Pinata public). | `https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/` |

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

- **White Screen / Crash:** Check the browser console. If you see "CRITICAL: Failed to initialize AppKit", verify `VITE_WALLET_PROJECT_ID`.
- **404 on Refresh:** Ensure the `_redirects` file exists in the build output. We have added it to `packages/web/public/_redirects`.
- **Upload Failed:** Verify `VITE_PINATA_JWT` is correct and has write permissions.
